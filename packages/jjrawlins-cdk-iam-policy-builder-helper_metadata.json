  "summary": "A CDK construct that helps build IAM policies using the AWS IAM Policy Builder dump. Normally it is better to use cdk-iam-floyd, However, I found that cdk-iam-floyd currently is not jsii compliant so I wasn't able to use it in my jsii compliant projects in languages that are not typescript or python.",
